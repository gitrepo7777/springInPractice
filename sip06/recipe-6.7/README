This chapter explores authentication using Spring Security 3.

In recipe 6.7 we learn how to secure user passwords at rest in the database using hashing and salt.

Any existing accounts (including juan, elvira and any accounts you created in recipe 6.6) will no longer work, because
the passwords aren't hashed or salted. Instead, create new accounts using the registration form and inspect the
passwords in the database.
