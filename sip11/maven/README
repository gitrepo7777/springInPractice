To run the plugin:

1) Make sure it's installed.

2) Start the Skybase app since the plugin calls it.

3) Run

    mvn -e org.zkybase:skybase-maven-plugin:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:package

or, better:

    mvn -e skybase:package

since we're following the skybase-maven-plugin convention.

See http://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html for more info.
