In recipe 10.2 we write happy path integration tests using the Spring TestContext Framework.

To run this recipe:

1) Create a database called sip10_it. You don't need to do anything other than create the database as the integration
test script will create the schema and test data.

2) From the top-level directory, type

    mvn -e verify

to run the integration tests.
