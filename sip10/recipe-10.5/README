We show how to ignore a test in recipe 10.5. This is a useful alternative to commenting tests out or deleting them
altogether.

To run this recipe:

1) Create a database called sip10_it, if you haven't already done so. You don't need to do anything other than create
the database as the integration test script will create the schema and test data.

2) From the top-level directory, type

    mvn -e verify

to run the integration tests *except* for the two performance tests.

3) From the same directory, type

    mvn -e -Denvironment=ci verify

to run all integration tests, including the two performance tests.
